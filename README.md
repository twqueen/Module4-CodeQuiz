# Short Coding Quiz

## Description
A project utilizing concepts learned during week 4 of coding bootcamp. The majority of this application is completed using Javascript. Styling is mainly accomplished by Bootstrap and Google fonts. Most difficult part of this project is the multiple choice part of each questions. It took awhile to figure out why JS is not comparing the selection and the answer properly. The resolution was made by adjusting the placement of eventListener() to change the scope of the code. The local storage was also a bit of a challenge. I've also learned that setAttribute will only call on the first one that appeared in the code. Having multiple elements with the same class name will not work with eventListener.

## Installation

No installation needed for this application. Just run it on a browser. Google Chrome recommended.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
